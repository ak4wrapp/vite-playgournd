Certainly! Below is the complete setup for a **microfrontend architecture** using **React 19**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, with **AuthContext** shared between the Host and Remote applications. This setup ensures that there are no circular dependencies, and the Host shares authentication state via props.

### Final Folder Structure

```
/host-app
  /src
    /context
      AuthContext.tsx
    App.tsx
    RemoteApp.tsx
    main.tsx
  vite.config.ts
  package.json
  tsconfig.json

/remote-app
  /src
    RemoteComponent.tsx
    main.tsx
  vite.config.ts
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
```
### 3. **Running the Applications**

#### Step 3.1: Run the Remote Application

```bash
cd remote-app
npm install
```

Since its remote app we need to build and serve it so remoteEntry.js is available for host
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

#### Step 3.2: Run the Host Application

```bash
cd host-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. **Module Federation Setup Summary**

- **Host App** shares `AuthContext` using React Context.
- **Remote App** is dynamically loaded into the Host via React's `lazy` and `Suspense`.
- Authentication state is passed from the Host to the Remote via props (no circular dependencies).
- Vite's **Module Federation** is used to load the remote app dynamically in the Host, while **remote** exposes its component for the Host to use.

### 5. **How It Works**

- **Host App** (on `localhost:3000`): Provides authentication context and shares it via props to the **Remote App**.
- **Remote App** (on `localhost:3001`): Is loaded dynamically into the Host and displays authentication state based on the props it receives.

---

This structure ensures clean separation between the Host and Remote applications, avoids circular dependencies, and uses React context to share authentication state seamlessly across apps.
